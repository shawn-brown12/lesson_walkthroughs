# Lessons Revamped

---

## Goals

This Repository was made in order to review and create comprehensive notes to better understand data science, as well as to have a reference for virtually everything I have learned since starting my data science journey. Currently there is a directory for each major topic talked about in Codeup, and I want to eventually add new topics as I learn more and grow my skillset and knowledge base.
