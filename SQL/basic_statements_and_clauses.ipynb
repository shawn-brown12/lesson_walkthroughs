    "- As stated in the last workbook, strings in SQL are generally enclosed in single quotes. Some versions of SQL allow use of double quotes, but for compatibility with other DBMS, use single quotes. If a single quote is needed within a string, you can escape it with (`\\'`), of you can use two single quotes in a row (`''`).\n",

    "- Annotating code, regardless of the language, is incredibly important. Not only will it really help someone else reading your code and trying to decipher what is going on, it will help you in the future going back and reading what you've written. In MySQL, there are a couple ways to introduce a comment within code. Both of these are good for a single line of code:\n",

    "    - `#`\n",
    "    \n",

    "Another useful point to state; When using MySQL, a `;` signifies the end of a query. WHen writing queries to gather data or create a table, or to navigate through the database, whatever you're doing, you need to end each query with a `;`. If you don't you run the risk of an error happening, or the GUI will simply run the last query written. An example of this would be something like:\n",

    "Another super useful clause in a SQL query is the `WHERE` clause. It basically enables you to give a condition for when a given row will be displayed in your output.
