    "Functions are generally pretty straightforward. The Numerical functions work exactly as you would think they do.\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT MIN(col_name) \n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Will return a single entry, that being the smallest value from that column and table.\n",

    "And now, onto string functions. They work in the same way, but can be slightly more complex to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concat simply concatenates any number of strings or column names together, and looks like:\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT CONCAT('Hello, ', 'My ', 'Name ', 'is ', 'Shawn.');\n",

    "A very basic example that you'll likely never actually use, but it displays the syntax simply.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`SUBSTR` works pretty similary, but it takes a part of a string, instead of the whole thing. You need to supply the string you want to manipulate, the starting i ndex (which character to start from), and the length (the number of characters to extract)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SUBSTR('agcdefg', 2, 4);\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "The string here is 'abcdefg', and the starting point is the second index, which is 'b', and the number of characters to extract is 4, so it stops after 'e'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case conversions (`UPPER` and `LOWER`) work exactly the same way and is a very simple concept, so I'm not going to type out a whole example of it. Just know it takes in a string and either upper or lowercases the whole thing, with the syntax being the same as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace also works similarly, but is slightly more in depth, so I will type out an example. The syntax is like so:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT REPLACE(subject, search, replacement)\n",
    "```\n",
    "An example would be:\n",

    "```sql\n",

    "Date and Time functions can also be quite useful. One of the most common would be `NOW`, though `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` does the exact same thing. The syntax for `NOW` is quite simple, and returns the current time back in the `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT NOW();\n",

    "```sql\n",

    "              UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2014-02-04'),\n",

    "Last, at least for the basics of functions goes, we have `CAST`. It isn't *technically* a function, but it behaves similarly and is useful to know. Casting lets us convert, or cast, one data type into another. For the most part, you can treat a string as a number, or a number as a string, and MySQL will figure it out. So you could do something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT 1 + '4',\n",
    "       '3' - 2,\n",
    "       CONCAT('This is a number ', 123);\n",

    "|:---------|\n",
    "|I am output|\n",
